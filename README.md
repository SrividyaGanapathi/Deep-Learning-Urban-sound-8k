# UrbanSound8K Deep Learning Project

1. Create your branch.
2. Clone it to your local system. 
   (command: `git clone -b your_branch_name --single-branch https://github.com/bhavyakaushik17/Urbansound_deep_learning.git`) 
3. Download the and extract the dataset from https://goo.gl/8hY5ER into the Dataset folder.
4. Run all notebooks in Notebooks folder to verify everything is working on your local system.
5. Start contributing.

Note: Although I have implemented restrictions, please don't try to push changes directly to the master branch. Just create your own branch and push changes to that. Later on we can merge it to the master branch.

Always try to keep your branch updated with the master branch.
(command: `git pull origin master`)
